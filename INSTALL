Compiling
---------
Once the archive dezipped, go in the main directory and type 'make'. Then, indicate 
the path of the 'lib' directory in the variable environment named 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' 
typing: 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/lib:$PWD/lib/cln'

Examples
--------
Once the compiling finished, you can test the library. Go in the 'examples' directory 
and launch test programs by typing './example*' where '*' is an integer.
