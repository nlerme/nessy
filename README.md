* The [CLN](https://www.ginac.de/CLN/) library for efficient computations with all kinds of numbers in arbitrary precision.

Compilation
-----------
Once the archive is decompressed, just type `make` in a terminal. Then, indicate the path of the "lib" directory with the environment variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" by typing `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:directory_of_the_project/lib`.

Execution
---------
Examples illustrating the features implemented in the library are provided in the "examples" directory.

Documentation
-------------
The LaTeX / HTML documentation in the "doc" directory can be generated by typing `make doc` in a terminal.
